,Expert's rationale for directional effects assessment,,,Species with a wide geographic range; Portugal is far from the limits of the range,,,,,,"Species with a very wide latitudinal range, from southern to northern hemisphere",,,,,,Portugal near the southern limit of the distribution range; species likely to retreat north with increasing temperature. Southern Portugal will be most affected.,,,,,,"Temperate to sub-temperate species, southern limit in NW Africa; likely to become less abundant, especially in south of Portugal",,,,,
