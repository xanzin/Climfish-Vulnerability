,Expert's rationale for directional effects assessment,,,"The common ocotpus have shown a positive effect with the increase of SST (Gamito et al., 2015). 
 The positive effect has observed on pre-recruit distribution in the west Portuguese coast (Gamito et al., 2015). Nevertheless, a significant negative effect of SST on the pre-recruit distribution in the South Portuguese coast, where SST is higher, has been found (Gamito et al., 2015).",,,,,,"The temperature influence on the early life stages of wild L. vulgaris (Moreno et al., 2012). This is consistent with the fact that the paralarvae are essentially planktonic and thus SST should be a better predictor of early growth. 
 Under a scenario of global warming, the squid will experience a shorter paralarval stage, undergo faster growth, and mature younger and at a smaller size, similar to the warm cohort life strategy. This would apparently ultimately enhance survival, and favour recruitment and rapid turnover of the local L. vulgaris population (Moreno et al., 2012).
 At an individual level, elevated temperatures pose limitations to
 individual metabolism, namely concerning oxygen and food requirements (Pecl & Jackson, 2008). At the population level, density may increase to the point that density-dependent effects (e.g. increased intraspecific competition, higher levels of predation) come into play (Moreno et al., 2012).",,,,,,"In warmer areas show higher abundances of squid (non-standardized model) and SST positively influences inter-annual abundance changes (standardized model). Warmer ecosystems support higher metabolic rates, higher food intake and growth (Segawa and Nomoto, 2002; Semmens et al., 2004) and can therefore foster higher squid abundances.",,,,,,"There is a high presence and potential effect of endocrine disruption of chemicals used and associated with plastic additives in L. caudatos, with a high potential for bioaccumulation of microplastics in marine organisms and a serious threat to aquatic systems and human health (Salvaggio et al., 2019).",,,,,,"It was not possible to clearly separate the relative role of the impacts of fishing and climate change on the community, but a negative effect on monkfish (L. piscatorius) due to climate change is expected.(Le Floc'h et al., 2008).",,,,,,,,,,,,"There is uncertainty about how changes in the marine environment can affect salmonids, which can positively affect, cause an increase in water temperature, cause an increase in egg exposure and sometimes high recruitment, but it can also affect negatively (Hedger et al., 2013).",,,,,,"Conger conger has a high activity in warmer waters, with the highest rate of activity being recorded at 26ºC, at temperatures above 28ºC there may be activity limitations (Hori et al., 2019).",,,,,,"Seabass is a species that presents part of its life cycle in estuaries (Bento et al., 2016). This species will be affected at the level of decreased salinity in these ecosystems, according to Bento et al., 2016, in years with lower salinity, there are high population densities of juveniles in the estuaries, leading then to greater reproductive success.
 According to Vinagre et al., 2009 an increase in water temperature above 17ºC can increase high levels of mortality and affect the spawning period (Vinagre et al., 2009).",,,,,,"The predictions of temperature and salinity fluctuations can influence the migration of catadromous species to freshwater environments. In conditions with high rainfall or sharp differences between the temperature of sea water and coastal water, it may stop the migration of A. anguilla. In years of drought there was a decrease in catadromous species (Baptista et al., 2010).",,,,,,"The spawnign time of turbot is adapted to optimum temperatures for egg development, but that occasions with temperatures involving increased egg mortality may occur (Nissling et al., 2006).",,,,,,"According to Cattaneo-Vietti, a higher density of S. sarda is captured at higher temperatures, so it is possible to conclude that a higher temperature leads to higher population densities (Cattaneo-Vietti et al., 2013).",,,,,,"The temperature has a profound influence on physiological rates, tuna are known to make extensive vertical migrations to different temperature regimes during the spawning migration and to a lesser degree during spawning itself (Chapam,E.W et al., 2011).",,,,,,"Global warming climate change-driven effects have influence on the distribution of R. clavata in the North Sea, wherethis species was found to have a preference for warmer temperatures (Elliot et al., 2019) .",,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate change will not have a significant effect on P. Glauca (Mitchell, J. D. et al., 2014). Because P. Glauca is a species that has a high temperature range and is a species that is found in high depths",,,,,,"Pacific spiny dogfish were expected to be severely affected by climate change, as they rely on continental shelf bottom habitat as nursery areas (O’Brien, S. M et al., 2012).",,,,,,"Tempearature leads to highs density tof Scyliorhinus canicula, increased population size and high disposal survival rate (South & Dick, 2017). This will have implications for the sustainability of fishing in the Irish and Celtic seas, in which there is a great abundance of Scyliorhinus canicula, as acclimatization to the increase in temperature increases the maximum feeding rate, but alters the proportional consumption of sparse prey populations (South & Dick, 2017).",,,,,,"The increase of temperature leads to alteration in the upper limits of the sixgill shark depth range. In Comfort & Weng, 2015, observed temperatures up to 20.6 ºC expand the known thermal habitat of the sixgill shark. The animals generally spent short amounts of time in the warmest 3 ºC of their thermal range. Exposures to temperatures higher than 16 ºC were usually too short these observations may suggest a thermal ceiling (Comfort & Weng, 2015).",,,,,,"The increase of SST and primary productivity influence horse mackerel growth, with the strength and direction of these relationships changing with age (Tanner et al., 2019).",,,,,,"""According to the RCP 8.5 scenario (IPCC, 2014), it is expected that global temperature will increase ∼4 ◦C until 2100, which may be translated in increasingly hotter summers and warmer temperature patterns worldwide. As such, it is predictable that C. edule will be additionally impaired. On the one hand, the progressively higher summer temperatures will certainly further affect the performance of individuals and increase mortality rates. As such, these populations are likely to suffer increasingly severe mortality episodes."" (Verdelhos et al., 2015).",,,,,,"With an increase in SST H. didactylus, being a hot water fish, you will obtain better conditions to breed and increase its distribution to the North of Portugal (Robalo et al., 2013).",,,,,,"P. longirostris benefits from the continuous warming of the marine ecosystem, leading to a higher recruitment density, due to a higher survival rate in planktonic phases (Colloca et al., 2014)",,,,,,,,,,,,""" In a climate change scenario, our results combined with those extracted from the latest studies on NEA mackerel life cycle and population dynamics suggest that mackerel is likely to be affected in the future with subsequent consequences for the fishery and for mackerel predators and prey."" (Pitois et al., 2015)",,,,,,,,,,,,"A. antennatus, blue and red shrimp, shows preference for low temperatures, but it is a depth-water species that will soon be little affected (Masnadi et al., 2018).",,,,,,"Increased SST will lead to better conditions for growth and reproduction (Coad et al., 2014).
 
 ""The results from the present study indicate that adult growth response to increasing temperatures may, to some degree, be one of the underlying physiological mechanisms for this relationship. However, increasing temperatures can only support faster growth if sufficient prey is available.
 Due to its reproductive strategy, especially its indeterminate fecundity, boarfish are capable of reproducing as long as environmental conditions are favourable (Farrell et al., 2012). This suggests that such an observed increase in stock size and possible northward distribution expansion is not only the result of climatic conditions, but also a function of the species’ physiological capabilities.""
