,Expert's rationale for directional effects assessment,,,"According to Bruge et al. (2016), it is expected that the North-East Atlantic mackerel population shifts their spawning distribution westward (32 to 117 km) and northward (0.5 to 328 km) as the water temperature gradually warms up due to climate change. This can have impacts on the recruitment since the ""new"" areas might not fit all the needs for egg and larvae development (e.g. favorable winds and currents) (Bruge et al., 2016). In fact, over the last decades, the catch has become more dispersed and is taken in areas of deeper water due to climate changes (Hughes et al., 2015). ",,,,,,"Canary Islands (Spain), Jurado-Ruzafa et al. (2019) showed a positive correlation of landings with SST, and a negative correlation with Chl-a.",,,,,,"Taking into account the preferred temperature limits (8.8-20ºC) of Belone belone and its geographic distribution ""Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea...(Northeast Atlantic, Black Sea and Sea of Azov, Mediterranean Sea and adjacent parts of Atlantic Ocean, Madeira, Canary Islands, Azores, and south to Cape Verde, France to the Canary Islands including the Mediterranean)..."" in my opinion this species will have mainly neutral directional effects. The expected increase of SST in the Portuguese coast (0.8 ºc) during the next years will not be enough to provoke big effects on this species, it will be inside the preferred limit range. ",,,,,,"Sbragaglia et al. (2019) reported that counts of the D. vulgaris in artificial reefs (in the North Western Mediterranean Sea) were mainly positively correlated to water temperature. Recruitment (landings) of D. vulgaris has been positively correlated to wind patterns (influence coastal currents) in North and South of Portugal (Baptista et al., 2016), by increasing the food supply for larvae and promoting retention in settlement habitats. Recruitment (landings) of D. vulgaris has also been positively correlated to river discharge in North and South of Portugal (Baptista et al., 2016), by increasing inputs of organic matter and increasing food abundance for larvae. However, it is expected that river discharges decrease in the next years, and thus decreasing the recruitment. SST was negatively correlated with recruitment of D. vulagris in Centre of Portugal (Baptista et al., 2016), by affecting spawning events. According to Madeira ate al. (2012) D. vulgaris, may also face thermal stress, with the expected increase of SST.",,,,,,"Sbragaglia et al. (2019) reported that counts of the D. sargus in artificial reefs (in the North Western Mediterranean Sea) were mainly positively correlated to water temperature. Recruitment (landings) of D. sargus has been positively correlated to wind patterns (influence coastal currents) in North of Portugal (Leitão et al., 2016), by increasing the food supply for larvae and promoting retention in settlement habitats. SST was also negatively correlated with recruitment of D. sargus in North of Portugal (Leitão et al., 2016), by affecting spawning events. Egg size of D. sargus ""did not change with exposure to elevated pCO2, but hatching rate was significantly reduced under high pCO2. Survival rate was not affected by exposure to increased pCO2... (...) Otoliths were consistently larger under elevated pCO2 conditions for"" D. sargus (Faria et al. 2017).  The thermal sensitivity values estimated for D. sargus (low
level of thermal sensitivity, between 2 and 3) showed that this species is tolerant to 30°C (Vinagre et al., 2014).",,,,,,"Biochemical alterations provoked by contamination (urban areas and oil refinery) were more evident during the summer, and, in some cases, spring months, suggesting an association between the presence of chemical stressors and temperature-dependent seasonal physiological fluctuations, which contribute to the modulation of the toxic response (Ramos et al., 2014). Temperature affect specific larval growth rate (2.6-5.9% total width per day, from 11 to 24°C), reducing the development time to the cyprid from 25 days at 11°C to 10 days at 24°C (but mortality increase over 90% above 22°C) (Franco et al., 2017). Rearing temperatures of 15-20°C maximized total survival (19-31% respectively) and growth (Franco et al., 2017). Salinity did not affect growth and survival significantly (Franco et al., 2017). Fanco et al. (2015) suggested that ""increasing temperature might decrease development time and accelerate egg lamella maturation, as food availability was not limiting"" (this would allow for multiple release peaks).",,,,,
