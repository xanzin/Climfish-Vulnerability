,Expert's rationale for directional effects assessment,,,"Both temperature and pH have distinct effects on the bioaccumulation of
radionuclides and metals in cuttlefish embryos, but these effects seem to be compensated by animal
physiology (Lacoue-Labarthe et al., 2012). Landings have been positively related to SST in the southwest
coast of Portugal (Gamito et al., 2015). Low genetic interpopulation variability (Shaw and Pérez-Losada,
2000). Adult sepia seems to be resilient to long term increased pCO 2 (Gutowska et al., 2008). Embryos more
resilient to ocean warming than Loligo sp. (Pimentel et al., 2012).
",,,,,,"Positive effect of SST on pre-recruit distribution and landings has been
described (Gamito et al., 2015). However, in the south coast of Portugal, the effect is reversed and SST
could be negatively related to landings of octopus in this region (Gamito et al., 2016). The same in Tunisia
(Chédia et al., 2010). Weight losses and mortality were recorded when temperature increased 3oC: their
temperature range seems to be a bit narrow for some areas in the Mediterranean (Aguado and Barcia,
2003). Temperature increase of 3oC caused an increase in embryonic metabolic consumption (Lopex et al.,
2016). Experiments in Portugal show 30% mortality increase with +3oC. The percentage of premature
paralarvae also will increase, affecting connectivity and dispersal ability. Premature paralavae increased,
from 0% to 18% by increasing temperature from 18 to 21oC (Repolho et al., 2014).
",,,,,,"Ocean acidification (pH 7.5) and summer warming (19°C) led to a significant drop in the survival rates of summer embryos (47%, P<0.05). Besides pronounced premature hatching, a higher percentage of abnormalities was found in summer embryos exposed to future warming and lower pH (P<0.05). Upper thermal tolerance limits were positively influenced by acclimation temperature, and such thresholds were significantly higher in late embryos than in hatchlings under present-day conditions (Rosa et al., 2014). The influence of higher temperatures on the egg and adult stages may be opposing forces on the life-history. The process of climate change will likely result in squids that hatch out smaller and earlier, undergo faster growth over shorter life-spans and mature younger and at a smaller size. Individual squid will require more food per unit body size, require more oxygen for faster metabolisms and have a reduced capacity to cope without food (Pecl and Jackson, 2008)",,,,,,"In the Mediterranean, increasing occurrence and density trends of the species were observed for all life stages in recent years. Phenological shifts seem to occur due to warming temperature. No clear relationships with environmental variables were observerd. There is a lack of knowledge on the effect of environmental variables on the population dynamics of this species.",,,,,,"There is a general lack of information regarding the species ecology, population trends and threats. As a species inhabiting big depths, the exposure to climate change should be, in principle, low. Temperature increase could be compensated by displacement of the population to different depths or latitudinal shifts. Its ecological niche seems to be broad to allow for adaptation mechanisms.",,,,,,"There is latitudinal shift in the distribution range, however, as this species occurs Northwards from Mauritania, no significant change is expected for Portuguese waters. Few works relate the relationship between environmnetal variables and population dynamics for this species in Portuguese latitudes. Most of the studies relate to the Northern limit of occurrence. Important movements between spawning grounds and other areas have been reported (Velasco et al., 2008). As this is a widely-distributed deep-water species, it is expected to not be very exposed to environmental change.",,,,,,"This species is known to accummulate contaminant metals, although no relationship with fish weight or environmental variables has been detected. If the liver is discarded, consumption does not entail any risk for human health (Afonso et al., 2007). This fish is ussually infected by Anisakis (Cruz et al., 2009).",,,,,,"Traits such as age at first maturity, longevity and fecundity decrease with increasing temperature whilst egg size increases with temperature. Water flow influences the accessibility of rivers for returning adults and speed of both upstream and downstream migration. Extremes in water flow and temperature can decrease recruitment and survival. There is reason to expect a northward movement of the thermal niche of anadromous salmonids with decreased production and population extinction in the southern part of the distribution areas, migrations earlier in the season, later spawning, younger age at smolting and sexual maturity and increased disease susceptibility and mortality (Jonsson & Jonsson, 2010).",,,,,,"Fisheries of juveniles still exist for this species. The range of distribution is expanding in the Northeast Atlantic, although at a regional scale population could be declining. Standing stock biomass assessment also report increase in the last 5 years. This is a species with high commercial value, captured, in part (~33% of Portuguese landings) by trawling. Plankton productivity could be relevant for recruitment success as this species exibits long planktonic larval duration. Negative relationship between hake abundance and deep colder waters was observed in the Mediterranean (Maravelias et al., 2007).

In the eastern of the Bay of Biscay, years of massive inflow of the eastward shelf-edge current produce low recruitment indices, due to larvae and pre-recruits being transported away from spawning areas to the open ocean. Under these conditions, high mortality is expected because of the difficulties juveniles have in finding the shelf grounds. On the other hand, the transport of larvae within anticyclonic mesoscale structures moving towards the recruitment areas will be an aid to recruitment. These eddies displace westward according to the condition of potential vorticity conservation. When orographic features, such as big capes, occur in their drift path their eastern edges are held back. This situation causes patches of recruits to be located east of the main capes of the western Cantabrian Sea (Sánchez & Gil, 2000). Upward motions of nutrient-rich deeper water masses were found close to the recruitment areas, stemming from variations of the vorticity field by mesoscale eddies. The resulting enhanced primary production seems to affect the distribution and size of hake recruit concentrations (Sánchez & Gil, 2000)",,,,,,"This is a species with high commercial value and subject to high fishing pressure locally. Genetic differentiation is high in Northeast Atlantic (Correia et al., 2012). Few information is available relating environmental variables and fish abundance or distribution. Resilience to fisheries is low. Spawning areas remain unknown despite high commercial value. Landings have been decreasing in Ireland and Brittish Islands, probably because of overexploitation.",,,,,,"Nurseries of this species are located in coastal areas such as estuaries or coastal lagoons. This species has aclimation process to increased temperature, although prolonged exposition to high temperature could result in lower fitness (Vinagre et al., 2012). River drainage has been realted to survival success of larvae in estuarine nurseries, so decreased river flow could affect  negatively recruitment (Vinagre et al., 2009)",,,,,,"Species dependent on rivers to complete their life cycle, subject to many anthopic threats. Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in A. anguilla – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding grounds (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim et al. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi et al 2005) during periods of increase and decline.
The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif et al. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to the metamorphosis of larvae into glass eels being impeded by the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller et al. 2009). Pacariz et al. (2014), however, found that the overall success of drift of larvae from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958-2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson et al. (2012). As such, the most recent WGEEL report claims that there is still practically nothing known about the dynamics of the oceanic phase of the eels life history (ICES WGEEL 2013).
We still lack information on the marine life of eels.",,,,,,"Decreasing salinity imply decreasing egg survival (Nissling et al., 2006). It is concluded that growth and food conversion efficiency of juvenile turbot can be improved by rearing them at intermediate salinities in the upper temperature range (Imsland et al., 2001). Temperature increase could be beneficial for this species, while salinity drop could have negative effect.",,,,,,"This is a very widespread species that is fairly fast growing and abundant in many areas. It has been caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries for a long period of time with no evident overall population declines. It sometimes enters estuaries and has a depth range of 0–200 m. It can adapt to gradual but not sudden changes in the environment and may occur in water temperatures between 12 and 27°C and salinities between 14 and 39. It preys upon sardines, squid, anchovy, mackerel and other small fishes (Collette 2003). This species is migratory (Sabates and Recasens 2001) and spawning season and size of maturity varies between regional populations (Valeiras and Abad 2006). In most parts of the Mediterranean, it spawns between May and July but off Algeria spawning extends to July. In the northwestern Atlantic, it spawns in June and July.

As a fast growing and pelagic species, increasing temperature will probably favour their growth and fecundity. They prey upon a wide diversity of organisms so it seems to be an adaptable species. The higher increase of planktonic productivity in the north regions could be beneficial favouring larval and early young survival.",,,,,,"This species is highly exploited by commercial fisheries. It is also being farmed in the Mediterranean, where breeding individuals are removed from the population but are not considered in the fisheries statistics.
As a highly migratory species, temperature increase could modify the spawning areas and periods (Muhling et al., 2011). Population fluctuations have been found to be negatively related to temperatture, which could reflect changes in migration patterns due to temperature change (Ravier & Fromentin, 2004).
The effect of climate change is not clear on this widely-distribute species. It will certainly have an effect on the timing and geographic extent of the reproduction, but this does not imply negative effects. On the other hand, increasing temperature could be beneficial for fecundity, at the cost of decrasing larval size. The NAO index was found to be related to the recruitment success of this species (Borja & Santiago, 2002), but the high uncertainty on the future of this index (Visbeck et al., 2001) does not lead to any conclusion on the likely effect on the population of thuna.",,,,,,"Habitat suitability could decrease in the are as a consequence of climate change (Jones et al., 2013). This is a species with low fecundity and slow growth with direct development, so response to climate change could be slower than in other faster-living species.",,,,,,"This species has a wide range of distribution and, as it is a deep water species, the level of exposure to climate change should be lower than other species. However, its life history, characterized by very low fecundities, makes population growth to be extremely low. Because of this, the species should respond very slowly to climate change. This species is particularly vulnerable to exploitation in European waters because its entire reproductive cycle is susceptible to the deepwater fishery. For example, mature females give birth in shallower waters where their catchability may increase (Clarke et al. 2001).  C. coelolepis has a high dispersal potential within the eastern Atlantic, and its apparent spatial segregation by size and maturity stage suggest large-scale migration associated with the reproductive cycle (Veríssimo et al., 2011).
 ",,,,,,"This is a species with low fecundity, although its lifespan, age at first maturity are not as high as in other sharks, which points to a not so pure r life history. This species is highly exploited in the Atlantic, where it is defined as a targeted bycatch. However, population trends are more or less stable through time. It is an open ocean pelagic species, so it is less exposed to environmental change than other species. It feeds on a wide variety of marine organisms, so it is able to adapt to change in the food web (Queiroz et al., 2005)",,,,,,"This is a species with very low fecundity, extremely long gestation period and longevity, the highest of any shark. Because of this the replenishment potential is low, as it is the response to environmental change. It has been detected some changes in the life history of the species related to the age at maturity and fecundity, however, these changes happened before drastic climate change and could be driven by fishing pressure (Taylor and Gallucci, 2009)",,,,,,"This species is highly dependent on crustaceans and molluscs for feeding. This can be threat as these organisms are more susceptible to suffer the effects of climate change, specially in Southern Portugal. The fecundity of the species is low, although this species is widely distributed in European waters, which demonstrates its resilience. This species is known to accumulate heavy metals (Jeffree et al., 2006).",,,,,,"Few information is available on the effect of environmental variables to the biology or ecology of this species. Growth is slow and fecundity low, which makes this species specially vulnerable to climate change and fishing. It can feed on a wide variety of organisms, which gives the species resilience to change. In this regard, expected climate change impact are more or less neutral.",,,,,,"This is a fast growing-high fecundity species. If elevated environmental pCO2 and temperature lead to slower recovery after emersion of species in the intertidal zone, then some predominantly subtidal species that also inhabit the low to mid shore, such as N. puber, may have a reduced physiological capacity to retain their presence in the low intertidal zone, ultimately affecting their bathymetric range of distribution, as well as the structure and diversity of intertidal assemblages (Rastrick et al., 2014). Necora puber appears less sensitive to low pH than many other species examined acutely. However, local acidification as a result of ocean CO2 dispersal or leakage from geological sequestration is likely to compromise even this species (Spicer et al., 2006). 
As the expected change in pH for the period of interest is not very significant, and the increase of temperature could be beneficial for fecundity and growth, the negative impacts of climate change due to acidification could be somehow compensated. Also the increase of zooplankton production (specially in the North of Portugal) could be beneficial for survival of the larval phase.",,,,,,"Hatching of larvae, fecundity and larval survival were higher in experiments simulating high temperatures in European waters (Schmalenbach & Franke, 2010). However, higher environmental temperatures could imply a mismatch of the biology of the species with environmental factors or with planktonic resources for the larvae. In relation to ocean acidification early benthic juvenile lobsters are sensitive, in terms of physiology and life history traits, to both ocean acidification and carbon capture and storage, with ocean warming sometimes mitigating and at other times increasing sensitivities (Small et al., 2016). At the larval stage, despite no observed effects on survival,carapace length, or zoeal progression, ocean acidification related (indirect) disruption of calcification and carapace mass might still ad-versely affect the competitive fitness and recruitment successof larval lobsters with serious consequences for populationdynamics and marine ecosystem function (Arnold et al., 2009).",,,,,,"The phyllosoma larvae of lobsters makes possible an extremely high dispersal for this species. Even if temperature increase is expected to shorten the planktonic larval duration, it will still be very long, being enhanced by the shape of these larvae, adapted to be dispersed by oceanic currents for very long distances. The most consistent environmental response is of growth and reproduction to temperature. Growth rates increase with increasing temperatures in a parabolic function, tapering and then declining as the boundaries of thermal tolerance are reached. With increasing temperature the intermoult duration decreases. Once the upper thermal boundary is reached, increases in temperature result in longer intermoult duration and smaller growth increments so that growth is reduced. Declines in temperature generally suppress moulting, and consequently reptantians rarely moult in winter. Increasing temperature decreases the time for egg incubation, larval development and the maturational age (Green et al., 2014). 
 ",,,,,,"This species could expand North its range of distribution due to climate change, as the thermal range of tolerance is a narrow, with increased temperatures causing limited capacity for ventilation and circulation, causing insufficient oxygen supply. Its larval phase, consisting on only 2 zoeae is shorter than other decapods, so its dispersive potential is lower.",,,,,,"This is species is limited by the substrate where they inhabit, which prevents the displacement northwards of the population in the context of climate change. The thermal tolerance range is not very large, and they could be very susceptible to ocean acidification.",,,,,,"This species should not be, in principle very exposed to the effects of climate change. Its diet is diverse, and inhabits deep waters, with a high movemente ability. Some displacement of the population could be expected to higher latitudes, but this does not have to be negative for the Portuguese stocks, as it is widely distributed in these latitudes.",,,,,,"The southern limit of the distribution range of this species coincides, more or less, with Portugal. So any displacement northwards of the stock could eventually decrease its stock, specially in the southern regions. The temperature tolerance for embryonic development has been found to be narrow (Coombs and Hiby, 1979), which could affect the spawning and nursery areas located mainly in the British Islands and Norway respectively (ICES 2013)",,,,,,"This is a species which seems to tolerate warm waters showing higher growth rates in the Southern part of Portugal (Tanner et al., 2009). Due to its bathymetric habits it is not very exposed to climate change, which, in adition to high fecundity and fast growth makes it a ",,,,,,"Specially captured by trawling and as by-catch of other species. Fecundity is high, but growth is not as high as in other pelagic similar species. Its geographic range is found in Southern regions and in the Macaronesia. Ocean warming could favour the displacement of the population to higher latitudes.",,,,,,"The species is very common and widespread in Portuguese waters. The species is adapted to warm environments such as the Mediterranean sea, so it should be able to adapt to inmediate climate change conditions in Portuguese waters, specially in the North where the upper thermal limit is still far to be reached (Klimogianni et al., 2004). The species is known to accummulate some heavy metals (Giannakopoulou & Neofitou, 2014)",,,,,,"Populations along the southwest coast of Portugal are intensively fished and the high exploitation rate suggests that the stock could be overfished (Gonçalves and Erzini 2000). It is a relatively long-lived and slow growing species. In the Algarve (southern Portugal) this species feeds on a wide variety of crustaceans (Pita et al. 2002) The total potential annual fecundity varies between 31,670 and 554,070 eggs per female. Temperature has a strong effect on the feeding activity of the seabream; below 16°C there is a significant decrease in feeding (Wassef & Eisawy, 1985).",,,,,,"Among Sparids, D. vulgaris is a relatively slow growing and a moderate-lived species, with a maximum observed age of 12 years. Total length at maturity (TL 50) was 17.6 cm for males and 17.1 cm for females, which corresponds to an age of about 4 years (Mouine et al., 2010). This can make it more vulnerable to climate change than other fast living fish species. In any case, the geographic range of D. vulgaris is more extense to the South than the North of Portugal, suggesting that there is space for this species to move northwards. Its diet is also diverse, feeding on crustaceans but also algae or worns, so it should be adaptable. It does not have special needs for specific habitats.",,,,,,"The species distribution is centered in Portugal, so in an scenario of a northward displacement caused by climatic change, no relevant implications from the Portuguese point of view would be expected. It is a species inhabiting intermediate depths, so the level of exposure is not very high. The weakest life stage is the juvenile, which uses to be associated to shallower, coastal areas. The diet is P. acarne is varied. The species is specially captured by trawling in the north, which could threat its environment. Landings of this species have been positively assoacitaed to increasing temperature in the Mediterranean (Recasens et al., 2007) ",,,,,,"This species shows great flexibility of habitat preferences and is very widespread in European waters. Expected climate change variations for the near future in Portugal are likely going to have a neutral effect on the distribution and production of this species, which is a fast living, high fecundity species.",,,,,,"The species is known to accummulate heavy metals and could be a threat for human consumption (Bat et al., 2018). Juveniles enter estuaries and coastal lagoons, which could represent a weak aspect in the resilience of the species to climate change due to higher temperature increase, pollution and sea level rise. The ability to feed on sediments, however, makes the species somehow independent on plankton productivity or crustaceans, which could be more afected by temperature or pH variations due to climate change.",,,,,,"The interaction between altered temperature and pH conditions due to climate change could affect in very different ways the metabolism and physiology of gilthead sea bream (Vargas-Chacoff et al., 2009). Scapes from aquaculture constitute a threat to the wild populations, and could be behind the increase of the population in the Mediterranean sea. Its dependence on coastal lagoons and coastal waters could also represent a problem given the higher impact of climate change on these environments, in relation to open waters (higher temperature increase, sea level rise, pH, extreme events, etc.)",,,,,,"The species diet is wide and flexible. Juveniles are ussually associate to coastal waters, which could increase the level of exposure to climate change impact.",,,,,,"The species shows a coastal distribution and is often associated to seagrasses (Vinagre et al., 2010). These habitats are expected to highly suffer the impact of the climate change in Portugal, so this poses a threat to the species. A multi-model approach revealed autumn, winter and spring seasonal effects to be related with northwest, southwest and Algarve coastal catch rates, respectively, indicating a possible coastal longitudinal gradient related with given periods of spawning and larval availability (Leitão et al., 2016). The environmental variables related to white seabream catches were sea surface temperature, upwelling index or the NAO index among others, depending on the region of Portugal evaluated.",,,,,,"This species has been reported with skeletal deformities most likely attributed to chemical water pollution in the southern North Sea. The species has a narrow range of tolerance to temperatures, but it can inhabit different environments. Its diet is varied.",,,,,,"There is not much information on the ecology and biology of this species. Its dependence, during the juvenile phase, on estuaries and coastal lagoons makes it vulnerable to climate change. General population trend has been described as decreasing and it is categorized as vulnerable by the IUCN. There is no data on fecundity, but it seems to be a fast living species.",,,,,,"This species is known to consume microplastics, specially individuals in worst condition  (Sbrana et al., 2020). This is species is widely distributed and abundante in all the Portuguese territory. Its diet is variable and reproduces and grows frast.",,,,,,"The larvae of T. draco may have a need for relatively warm water with a relatively low salinity to hatch in greater numbers. Trachinus draco grows slowly, but ocean warming could accelerate this and other life history traits such as enhanced fecundity. Its catchability is high.",,,,,,"There is a general lack of information on this species. Population trend is not known and part of its biology is not known.
 It is known to inhabit the continental shelf and feed on crustaceans. It should not be, in principle, very exposed to environmental change. Fishing pressure is also low and it is captured as a by-catch.",,,,,,"The species is found in coastal areas and depths until 700 m, many times associated to rocky areas with red algae (Ordines et al., 2009). These areas could suffer the impact of climate change increasing the vulnerability of Scorpaena notata. Its reproductive strategy has been classified as intermediate between oviparity and viviparity, which explains the relative low fecundity (Muñoz et al., 2005). Because of this, this species could be exposed to climate change and its resilience could be somehow low in principle. In addition its geographic range and temperature preferences range are narrow, pointing again to a narrow plasticity.",,,,,,"There is a lack of knowledge on the ecology of this species. Only some aspects of its reproductive biology are known because it has been shown to be important in the field of medicine, with the aim of rearing the species in laboratories. It is a slow growing species with low fecundity. It also exhibits complex courtship arenas where males congregate and sing together.
",,,,,,"Horse mackerel recruitment was found to be negatively related to sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic and Iberian waters. Other environmental factors such as wind regime and upwelling were related to horse mackerel catches, with a temporal lag of 2 years. The coastal/pelagic environment where they are mostly found and their high mobility make them to not be very exposed to environmental change. They are fast growing with high fecundity.",,,,,,"Abundant in cold and temperate shelf areas, forms large schools near the surface. They overwinter in deeper waters but move closer to shore in spring when water temperatures range between 11º and 14ºC. The species is subject to high fishing pressure.  About 50% of the variability in the Atlantic mackerel recruitment may be explained by means of environmental variables, such as turbulence. Other variables, such as upwelling and NAO, are only slightly, or not, statistically significant.",,,,,,"In years with high abundance, the Portuguese fishery expands to the northwestern areas of the Iberian Peninsula. The expansion of the stock in recent years appears to be caused by improved recruitment although other factors might have contributed. The complementary spatial distribution of chub mackerel and sardine and the inverse correlations between their frequency of occurrence, landings and recruitment indices suggest some interaction between the dynamics of the two species, possibly associated with climatic variation.
",,,,,,"This is a widespread species in all European Atlantic coasts and it is not very targetted by fisheries. It inhabits the pelagic neritic zone and has great mobility, forming shoals. Its fecundity is not very high however, and eggs are ussually attached to substrates. No information on the impact of environmental variables is available for this species, so more information would be needed to provide a formed opinion on the evolution of this species in scenarios of climate change.
",,,,,,"The species can be significantly affected by ocean acidification and the increase in upwelling events that could wash away larvae with low swimming ability. It can be highly exposed to sea level rise. Its narrow thermal preferrend range can supose a problem in the South were temperatures are expected to increase sharply. 
",,,,,,"This species inhabits the coastal subtidal area, which increases its exposure to environmental variables in the context of climate change. It is specially vulnerable to ocean acidification and sea level rise. Temperature rise could have effects on growth and fecundity. ",,,,,,"There are relevant differences across regions in the ecology of this species. It lives at different depths in the North and in the South of Portugal, which implies different vulnerabilities. The directional effects of climate change are, however, neutral, as this species is more resilient than other bivalves. On the Northwest coast, the combined effect of NAO indices and sea surface temperature had a positive effect on S. solida fisheries, particularly during the spawning season. On the Southwest coast, the variation of S. solida catches was negatively associated with wind magnitude and positively related with South–Southeast winds. Winter river discharges and summer sea surface temperature negatively affected S. solida catches on the South coast (Baptista & Leitao, 2014).",,,,,,"The species is vulnerable to ocean acidification and sea level rise. The relatively long planktonic larval duration exposes it to changes in the currents and upwelling patterns. In the South region, where temperature increase is expected to be higher, the impact on growth and development should be higher.",,,,,,"In warm environments, the species is known to expand its spawning period. It is a calcareous species inhabiting coastal areas, specially sandy bottoms. These environments are very exposed to sea level rise, ocean acidification and erosion caused by extreme events. The species could suffer a northward expansion due to environmental warming.",,,,,,"A fast living species with high fecundity. It inhabits high depths that would not be highly exposed to climate change. Depth trawling is a threat for the species as habitat gets highly altered. Calcareous structure feeding on invertebrates, so it could be vulnerable to ocean acidification. The abundance of P. longirostris showed a clear increasing trend in the Tyrrhenian Sea, significantly correlated with the fishing effort index (number of days at sea per month), the sea surface temperature and the wind‐mixing index. The temporal variations in the stock of P. longirostris, which has a preference for warm waters, were positively correlated with the rise of the sea surface temperature and the decrease of wind circulation (Ligas et al., 2011).",,,,,,"The habitat it inhabits should not be very exposed to climate change. The species has high movility due to planktonic larvae and during the adult phase. Warming could benefit fecundity and growth. Trawling is a threat for this population, although they show fast population growth rate.
",,,,,,"This is a species with low commercial interest. It inhabits coastal areas that could be exposed to sea level rise and ocean acidification. It is known to accummulate heavy metals. It is a fast living organisms, but fecundity is not very high compared to other organisms.
",,,,,,"Portugal is at the Northern extreme of the range of occurrence of this species. In this regard, a Northwards displacement of the population due to climate change should not affect the Portuguese stock negatively. The species has high mobility and is associated to sand or muddy bottoms, so it should not be very exposed to environmental change. The species fecundity and growth are relatively high so it has a high replenishment potential. 
",,,,,,"Macroramphosus scolopax is distributed globally in tropical and temperate coastal waters.. It is a benthopelagic species, inhabiting sandy and muddy botoms and being absent from coastal areas. In this regard its exposure to environmental change is not very high. Information on its fecundity and life cycle is scarce. Snipefish (8-17 cm) were regularly found off Portugal, occasionally in large concentrations, but were absent from the Gulf of Cadiz. Off northern Portugal, snipefish were distributed along the outer shelf and upper slope, clearly separated from sardine (the most abundant species in the inner shelf) and partially overlapping with blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), the most abundant species in the upper slope. Snipefish were most abundant in the outer shelf of south-western Portugal, preferentially distributed in large aggregations around the Canyon of Setubal and partially overlapping with the distribution of boarfish (Capros aper) and blue whiting (both abundant in the upper slope of south-western Portugal). Off southern Portugal snipefish were almost exclusively distributed in the outer shelf and were significantly smaller than in south-western (intermediate) and northern Portugal (large) (Marques et al., 2009)",,,,,,"This a mesopelagic species with high mobility forming shoals. Fishing pressure is not elevated. No data on fecundity is available, but longevity based on otoliths has been estimated of 26 years, suggesting that this is not a fast living species. Feeds mainly on crustaceans and occurs in the Northeast Atlantic, being widely distributed.",,,,,,"This is a demersal to midwater, neritic species. It is common over Posidonia beds and on sandy or muddy substrata (Tortonese 1986). It occurs from shallow water to a depth of 50 m (Louisy 2002), although reported also in depths of 30 to 90 m (Labropoulou and Papaconstantinou 2005), and in the Ligurian Sea this species was caught to down 110 m depth (Relini et al. 1986). It feeds on zooplankton and is a protogynous hermaphrodite.
",,,,,,"A big effort to understand the link between pilchard stock and environmental variables has been carried out. Recruitment variability has been found to be related to sea surface temperature (Santos et al., 2012). The positive relationship between upwelling intensity from May to August and nutrient concentration in surface layers could explain why landings of sardine were higher when Ekman transport over the preceding year was lower. Finally, in years with low NAO, sardine recruitment success was higher. When NAO is lower than average, the winter/spring temperatures are warmer and transport offshore is lower (Guisande et al., 2001).
.",,,,,,"Temperature and zooplankton biomass are expected to enhance growth and fecundity of this short-living species (Taboada and Anadón, 2016). Fisheries are an important determinant of the species biomass together with environmental variables. The implementation of harvest control rules seems to be adequate in anchovy population control and could have avoided the population collapse of 2005 in the Bay of Biscay (Bueno-Pardo et al., 2019).
",,,,,,"Much information is still needed to infer the evolution of this species in a context of climate change. It is associated to warm waters (~24ºC) and it has not been yet cited in the North of Portugal. The only catch reported comes from the South coast. A northward displacement of the stock is expectable, favouring the occurrence of the species in the Central region of Portugal. Small pelagics respond rapidly to environmental variables due to short life cycles, in consequence, their stocks are highly variable. The length-weight parameters, sex ratio, size at first sexual maturity, period of reproduction and condition factor of S. maderensis did not change significantly in the context of climate change (Ba et al., 2016).
",,,,,,"The life style of this species makes it resilient to environmental change, while the level of exposure should not be high. Warming could favour positively growth and fecundity, while acidification and sea level rise could affect negatively most of its prey's abundance, making the species to explore new habitats or areas. Few species consider the impact of environmental variables on this species, so assessing the impact of climate change is difficult.",,,,,,The feeding habits and mobility of this species makes it resilient to environmental change. They are widespread and considered as least concern by the IUCN. It shows high fecundity and fast growth.,,,,,,"Despite having characteristics typical of a resilient species, this is a highly vulnerable species to sea level rise, ocean acidification and changes in the upwelling pattern. Specifically, the upwelling pattern seems to be pivotal for larvae transport and recruitment, as well as for the availability of nutrients in coastal areas. Changes in the frequency of storms and extreme events could also affect importantly this species.",,,,,,"This species has a very high reproductive potential and fast growth. These characteristics explain its invasive capacity in European waters where it is an aloctonous species. No specific fishery is still developed in Portugal, although some catch has been yet reported in the South. This species suposes an ecological risk for other autoctonal species due to its voracious habits. Its dispersive potential is also very high due to high fecundity and larval transport mechanisms, so it is expected that it will be present in all the Portuguese continental territory in the next years.",,,,,,"This species is highly dependent on estuarine areas, expected to suffer the effects of climate change. The extensive use of oligohaline nurseries by juvenile weakfish despite the potential for reduced growth rate and growth efficiency compared to other zones, suggests this estuarine zone may provide a substantial refuge from predation (Landford & Targett, 1994).
",,,,,,"This species lives at big depths although can be also found in coastal shallow waters. This makes it to not be very exposed to environmental change. The larval phase is the most vulnerable phase to climate change, but some information is still missing to make a proper assessment of its vulnerability.
",,,,,,Fast living species with high fecundity inhabiting coastal areas on mud or sandy bottoms. It can be exposed to ocean acidification and changes in the upwelling patter that could wash larvae away. Temperature increase and the increase of the frequency of extreme events could affect the species biology. Increased temperature and ocean acidification produce oxidative stress on the tissues of this species. ,,,,,,"Aloctonous species in Portugal that was introduced through oyster cultures. HIgh reproductive potential and adaptability. Temperature increase could favor fecundity, while upwelling change patterns and acidification could influence negatively the stock. ",,,,,,,,,,,,"The species recruitment will probably be positively affected by the increase of planktonic production expected under scenarios of climate change. This is probably linked to enhanced upwelling, which could, on the other hand have negative effects on larvae as they could be washed away by strong currents. As this is mainly expected for the Northern region, the positive effect is expected to be lower in the North than in the other regions. Increased temperature, however, is expected to be high in the South. As this species is close to its Southern distribution limint in the SOurther Portugal, an increase of temperature o more than 1ºC could be problematic for the species survival.",,,,,
