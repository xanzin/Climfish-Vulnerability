,Expert's rationale for directional effects assessment,,,"Studies indicate that sea temperature increase due to climate change will only have a slight negative impact on the species. In addition, the larvae will benefit from a temperature increase in terms of survival.  
",,,,,,"Increase in temperature and PH will have a serious impact on the juvenile and larvae of the species. 
",,,,,,In-shore and off-shore migrations are affected by the increase in sea temperature. Number of individuals in coastal waters has been decreasing in recent years. .,,,,,,,,,,,,"This especies will be highly affected by climate change, especially during the larval stages/recruitment. 
",,,,,,"Increase in tempreture will have some negative effects at a celular level on the individuals, as well on the development of the gills. However, some studies also indicate that an increarse in temperature also brings some benefits when it comes to behavior and development of juveniles. 
",,,,,,"Increase in temperature will have a negative effect on the development/growing of juveniles, as well on the individuals of the especies at a molecular level (proteins, etc) .",,,,,,"Temperature seems to have an effect on the indivudals's size. Higher temperature = smaller size. 
",,,,,,"Increase in temperature leads to an increase in mortality for the especies. On the other hand, a decrease of the PH leads to a descrease in respiratory rate, and increase in amonia. Acidification by acumulation of CO2 also leads a reduction of the indiduals size/weight. Shells are also affected. 
",,,,,,,,,,,,"Occasional  stormy  episodes  may  destroy  some  spawning  habitats.  Climate  change  might  end  up producing population moves and epigenetic modifications
",,,,,,"Climate change has led many new invasive especies to appear in ecosystems/habitats where Boobs boops can found. This leads to competition between species, and the number of Boops boops individuals has been decreasing in recent years in invaded areas. Increase in temperature has a negative effect on the development/growing rate of juveniles. 
",,,,,,"An increase in salinity a deeper temperatures leads to physiological in individuals of Aristeus Antennatus. Increase in temperature and salinity leads do a decrease in 02 dissolved in water, which has a negative effect on the live cycle of individuals. Females are bigger in colder waters (it's safe to assume the opposote effect at warmer waters). However, the especies will benefit from climate change from a chain food perspective.  ",,,,,,"Temperature and PH increase lead to an increase in amonia, which affects growth and oxygen consumed by juveniles. Higher temperature is also associated with higher mortality in juveniles. However, it's worth noting that the especies adapts better to warner temperatures than colder. Still, it's a very vulnerable especies from a climate change perspective. ",,,,,,"This especies will lost its ideal habitat before the end of this century due to climate change and increase of sea temperature. In addition, several exotic especies are invading this ""ideal habitat"" due to climate change, which creates competition and places Microchirus Azevia in a vulnerable position. ",,,,,,,,,,,,The temperature increase has helped to increase the abundance of this especies in our coast. The lack of predators and lack of our interest from a fishing perspective also contributres to this.,,,,,,"Studies that took place in different locations of the Mediterranean sea seem to indicate that higher temperatures have a negative impact on the especies. Individuals that live in locations with higher temperature haver a smaller longevity. In addition, sex changes occur at a smaller size as well in waters with higher temperature, which means that either individuals grow less or that the female stage lasts less time.
",,,,,,"Some studies indicate that the especies abundancy have been decreasing in recent years along the African coast when compared to other especies, while its distribution has slowly been expanding NORTH. However, some studies also state that this especies is resilient to variations in temperature, and that climate change doesn't present itself as a major negative factor for Sardinella maderensis. ",,,,,,"An increase in water temperature will affect the acustic signals that inviduals produce to attract a partner. Higher temperatures also have a negative on the individual's growth. In addition, a study focused around the impact of climate change in NORTH American shores indicates that the impact on this species is moderated. Climate change has changed the distribution of the especies in recent years.",,,,,,"Increase in sea temperature will have an effect on the distribution of Brama brama. Being a migratory species, the temperature increase will affect its distribution during the migration process. There are already studies indicating that this species is invasive in some locations due to this.",,,,,,"A temperature increase in sea waters will have an impact on the distribution of Belone belone. Being a migratory species, an increase in temperature will influence the distribution during the migratory proccess. Increase in salinity also changes the distributio. Some studies indicate this especies as invasive in certain locations due to this. ",,,,,,"The temperature increase due to climate change poses a major risk for the species, as it's a species that it's highly pressured during heat waves. There's already a tendency for this especies to move its distribution to NORTH. This means that the abundance of this especies is in decline in SOUTHern portuguese coast. ",,,,,,"Climate change has led this species to alter its distribution, with Lithoganthis mormyrus now appearing in habitars/ecosystem NORTH of its previousbly known distribution. In these situations, the species has become invasive. ",,,,,,The species seems to benefit from a temperature increase from a reproduction process perspective. ,,,,,,"Being a species with low preffered temperature range, Trachurus trachurus is exposed to changes in temperature. There are already reports showing that years with cooler sea surface temperature favour the especies' recruitment due to events such as upwelling. The sea temperature increase has contributed in recent years for an increasing trend in upwelling indices, which contributed to a negative recruiment for the especies. Cooler temperatures are also in the best range for development and survival of juveniles. Although a recent study shows that eggs develop and grow faster at warmer temperatures, these experiments were carried out in a lab, therefore, the eggs weten't explosed to upwelling, currents, and other events. fasterA recent study focused around the changes in the NORTH Sea indicate that Trachurus trachurus is starting to migrate to much NORTHern enviorments in recent years. In addition, the especies is already showing a decreasing trend in abundance along the portuguese coast in recent years. Para além destes factores, o tamanho dos individuos também é afectado pela temperatura, sendo o tamanho superior a temperaturas mais baixas. ",,,,,,"Several studies have shown that the Spondyliosoma cantharus is showing an upward trend in  abundance in UK waters, something that is associated with the increase in water temperature. In addition, the species's abundance seems to be correalted to salinity, in the sense that ecossystems with higher salinity are preferable for individuals of Spondyliosoma cantharus. This in turn, means that climate change has a negative impact on the species (ice melting in NORTH and SOUTH poles decreases salinity of the ocean). ",,,,,,"Studies on the effects of climate change on Conger conger are scarce, but one such study on the Bristol Channel indicates that there's no correlation between climate change and any effects (positive or negative) on Conger conger.  However, another study that took place in the NORTH Sea points out that during severe winters in the NORTH Sea, high mortality happens to several species, such as Conger conger. With climate change, it's possible that the severe winters might actually become the norm rather than the exception. ",,,,,,,,,,,,"It's known that the species abundance has shown an increasing trend in recent years in the NORTHeast Atlantic and Mediterranea, with several studies indicating that the species is not affected by climate change, and might actually benefit from it. Some researches also tackled the hypothesis that the species is affected by acidification and increase of CO2 in the ocean, but aside from a few slight changes in behavior, Scyliorhinus seemed to adapt just fine to the conditions. Others decided to go deeper into the effects of temperature increase, and while some studies indicate that at higher temperatures juveniles face a higher mortality rate and adults are smaller in size, juveniles also mature much younger, which helps the species to reproduce faster.",,,,,,"Octopus Vulgaris will be highly affected by climate change. An increase in sea surface temperature will have a serious impact on juveniles. While it's true that the embrionic stage will be shorter, this also means a much higher juveniles mortality. Not only that, higher temperatura also means higher metabloic costs for the juveniles. This can be seen along the Portuguese coast, which saw the mean water temperature increase about 2ºC in the last few decades, where the abundance of Octopus Vulgaris is shown a decreasing trend. On the other hand, Octopus are well adapted to climate variables, and it's also true that juveniles benefit from strong upwelling events, something that should happen more often with climate change.",,,,,,"Parapenaeus longirostis is, and will, benefit from a sea temperature increase due to climate, as recent studies have shown that the abundance of this species has been increasing in recent years in the mediterranean sea due to climate change. In addition, not only has the species abundance been increasing, but the species is also expanding its distribution. ",,,,,,"Climate change will have a significant negative impact on Callista chione. Several studies have shown that both larvae and the individuals' shell grow much faster at warmer temperatures, which at first could be seen as a positive effect, however, and similar to lots of other species, survival rates are also lower at warmer temperatures. With climate change, Portugal will be exposed to more extreme weather events (storms, strong marine agitation, etc), and this will also affect this species as some studies have shown that waves can distress shell  growth  rate, with inviduals exposed to waves/marine agitation showing lower rates and shorter longevity. Finally, with climate change, this species will also be exposed to acidification. Individuals of this species, especially juveniles, exposed to levels of acidity higher than can handle will lead to injuries, development of fragile shells, and in the most severe cases deaths.
