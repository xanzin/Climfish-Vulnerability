,Expert's rationale for directional effects assessment,,,,,,,,,"Models used by Chedia et al. (2010) showed “SST significantly contributed to CPUE [catch per unit effort] variability; fishery production was influenced positively by cold season SST but negatively by hot season SST.”

Moreno et al. (2014) analyses environmental variables with pre-recruit aggregations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Distribution and abundance of this species, in the Barents Sea, are influenced by recruitment in the Atlantic stock and local climatic conditions (Heino et al., 2008). ""Changes in salinity can alter the ascent of larvae from their spawning depth towards the food-rich surface waters, which is critical for their survival"" (Adlandsvik et al., 2001 in Miesner & Payne, 2018).""",,,,,,"França et al. studied the use of the coastal areas adjacent to the Douro estuary as a nursery area for Trisopterus luscus. They determined that, even though none of the environmental variables is alone particularly important in determining the distribution and abundance of the species, the results suggest temperature as the variable more relevant. T. luscus may have preferences for higher water temperatures, but further studies are needed, particularly the relationship between the distribution and abundance of T. luscus and environmental variables and the assessment of the relative contribution of nursery areas to T. luscus stocks (França et al., 2004)",,,,,,,,,,,,"This species has different optimal temperatures associated with different life phases. It spawns in summer months, and the study suggests 18ºC as the optimum temperature for growth rate, efficiency of yolk utilization, hatching success and survival (Klimogianni et al., 2004). The rising temperature could affect these processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Verdelhos et al. (2015) studies provided some information relatively to the possible effects of extreme climatic events (heat waves and global warming) on the cockle C. edule: mortality increased, reaching 100% mortality above 32°C (LC50120 h = 28.01°C).

The combination of higher seawater temperature and acidification impaired cockle condition, even though the survival rate was not affected: metabolic rate increased and calcification decreased (mixed response on clearance rates) (Ong et al., 2017). “(…) higher energy requirements to compensate for the higher costs for basal maintenance and growth in future high pCO2 waters” (Ong et al., 2017).",,,,,,"In an experiment performed by Sobral & Widdows (1997), the species R. decussatus was subjected to temperatures between 20-35 °C. This increase revealed: (1) reduction of scope for growth and (2) shell valve gaping and desiccation. The authors concluded that temperatures above 28 °C can stress and weaken the clam, affecting its performance in water (Sobral & Widdows, 1997).

Regarding decreases in the pH (−0.4 and −0.7 pH units), Range et al. (2011) concluded through an experiment: “net calcification and growth of the clams were independent of the pH treatments” and “acidified treatments reduced mortalities of the clams (…) Reduced mortality was associated with a delay in the reproductive cycle”. Overall, should be considered not only biological but also ecological processes, and analyse at local scales (Range et al., 2011).",,,,,,"Two studies done in southern Portugal (Gaspar & Monteiro, 1999; Joaquim et al., 2008) indicated that the clam S. solida reacts to the increase in seawater temperature as a signal to initiate the spawning period. This environmental factor is crucial to the reproductive cycle of the species and a shift in the SST could disrupt the cycle and change the development and spawning timings.",,,,,,"Ensis siliqua shells were analyzed throughout the west coast of mainland Britain, for a range of trace metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, U, Ba, Sr and Mg). The relationship between the incorporation of these trace metals and environmental conditions, such as salinity, is complex. They obtained both increases and decreases on the concentration (Pearce & Mann, 2006)",,,,,,"Experiments considering two ocean acidification scenarios (ΔpH −0.3 and ΔpH −0.6), showed that the increase of pCO2 affects the early life stages of D. trunculus, causing a delay in hatching and reduced larvae survival (Pereira et al., 2016).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The increase of SST might affect the species’ spawning because it has a narrow optimum range, between 14–15°C for Portugal, as determined by Coombs et al. (2006). The warming of surface waters could also lead to a mismatch between the spawning season and other environmental variables (e.g. primary production) – affecting larval survival (Jghab et al., 2019). “Linear models reflect a negative relationship between sardine landings and SST and SSS, indicating that the long-term temperature and salinity changes in the Mediterranean could have a negative impact on sardine abundance.” (Jghab et al., 2019)",,,,,,"Several environmental variables may influence the spawning and distribution of the anchovy. In the Strait of Sicily, the egg abundance was lower during warmer years – being the preferred temperature between 18–19°C (Basilone et al., 2013). In the Adriatic Sea, the input of nutrient-rich riverflow positively impacted the anchovy fertility (Zorica et al., 2012) – our possible scenarios reveal a decrease in this variable which could potential affect negatively. Using the RCPs scenarios provided by the IPCC, projections about the anchovy future distribution were made: the results shown “a reduction in the probability of occurrence in all the regions located under 48 degrees N and an increase in more northern areas” which indicate the species’ presence in Portugal might be affected (Raybaud et al., 2017).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Several studies analysing the direct and indirect effects of climate change on C. sapidus have been done (e.g. Cunningham & Darnell, 2015; Giltz & Taylor, 2017; Glaspie et al., 2017; Glandon et al., 2019); pointing a broad spectrum of impacts (negative, neutral and positive) and indicating resilience. 
As recorded by Vasconcelos et al. (2019), this species distribution has established along the southern coast of Portugal, expanding its range of distribution. Studies suggest the increase of temperature will influence growth rates, where juveniles will reach maturity faster but with a smaller size (Cunningham & Darnell, 2015). For future scenarios of temperature and dissolved carbon dioxide in water (pCO(2)) in Chesapeake Bay, there was no significant effect on oxygen consumption in juveniles (Glandon et al., 2019). Experiments comparing the current and the predicted scenario for pH, showed a reduction in larvae size (<10%) and survival (<23%) (Giltz & Taylor, 2017). In terms of indirect effects, research conducted on clams preyed by the blue crab revealed that C. sapidus “in acidified trials had higher encounter rates [with clams]; however, this was offset by crabs taking longer to find the first clam in trials, and by increased occurrence of crabs eating only a portion of the prey available” (Glaspie et al., 2017).",,,,,,,,,,,,"Matozzo et al. (2013) performed experiments exposing individuals of C. gallina to a combination of decreased pH levels and increased temperatures, revealing oxidative stress and vulnerability of this species.",,,,,,"A few environmental variables affect this species’ growth, namely temperature and food availability (Purroy et al., 2018). There’s some degree of uncertainty of the directional effect, because even though climate change may affect the spawning duration, in Purroy et al. (2019) studies demonstrated adaptive capacity and reproduction strategies for better acclimatization to unfavourable conditions (e.g. resorption of the gonads). Combination of environmental factors is also decisive in the species’ success, being crucial to consider their dynamic together and not only one factor – e.g. temperature may have a negative effect, but if food is still available this effect may be diminished because both are important as shown in Purroy et al. (2018).",,,,,,"In a study by Huo et al. (2018), when exposed to ‘extremely high’ temperatures, the larvae and juveniles of R. philippinarum may suffer high mortality [18–28°C interval being the appropriate].

Studies analysing the effect of pH and pH-salinity combined revealed: (1) a compromise in the energy budget, and possibly disturb the feeding physiology and spawning capacity (Xu et al., 2016); (2) salinity may affect this species more than pH, and there were different kinds of responses according to the several combination scenarios (Velez et al., 2016).",,,,,,"Due to its calcium carbonate shell and inhabiting the intertidal zone, the mussel M. edulis could be more vulnerable to the increase of pH levels and ocean acidification. Based on the characteristics of its life history traits (early maturing, rapid growth and high fecundity), they could favour the species’ replenishment potential. Mussels can possibly benefit from the expected increase in the ocean’s productivity and, as a result, food availability (plankton). The species demonstrates a certain plasticity, being able to extend its planktonic larval duration until find suitable conditions for settlement (see MarLIN biotic database for further information and references). Even though this species is present throughout all Portuguese coast, its distribution can change in the future – if a shift to north occurs – as Portugal is located in its southern limit of distribution in this area (barely existing in north Africa, with a low relative probability of occurrence).

A study provided by Zittier et al. (2015) revealed that thermal stress is more relevant than ocean acidification (CO2 levels caused small effects) in North Sea mussels. On the other hand, Lesser (2016) defends ocean acidification as a factor that could possibly “narrow the thermal window of physiological tolerance for many invertebrates such as marine mussels”. Extreme events could also be taken in account when predicting the climate change effects for this species, as it inhabits the rocky intertidal shore – Seuront et al. (2019) discusses the decrease in thermal tolerance of this species to successive exposures, as heat waves are expected to magnify in intensity and frequency.",,,,,,"Due to its calcium carbonate shell and inhabiting the intertidal zone, the crab C. maenas could be more vulnerable to the increase of pH levels and ocean acidification. This crab also demonstrates a capability to live in variable habitats and conditions (with a wide range of tolerance in terms of both salinity and temperature).

Even if a shift towards north occurs, this species' distribution in Portugal will probably not be affected, as C. maenas southern limit is further south, in Mauritania.

A study by Bessa et al. (2010), revealed the endurance of this species to extreme drought events and decreased freshwater flow. During these periods, the green crab catches were higher and recruitment significant in the estuary. ",,,,,
